# Food Classification

This model tells the users the names of food in the photo such as burger, pizza, or sushi, by using image classification with re-trained model.This model may be especially helpful for tourists to understand food even if they donâ€™t know that food.This AI was created because I struggled with understanding the names of foods when traveling abroad, this AI helps me do that.

## The Algorithm

This project was developed using Jetson Nano. It uses a re-trained resnet18 model whose dataset consists of many foods images. When it is run, it uses the Food-Classification.py program. Food-Classification.py is python file which I coded  to determine foods of an inputted image. This python file work 
This model uses imagenet and resnet-18.  It uses imagenet to train the models. Resnet-18 is the base of the AI program. 


## Running this project

1. Make sure to have resnet18.onnx and labels.txt from this project downloaded on the Jetson Nano
2.
