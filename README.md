# Food Classification

This model tells the users the names of food in the photo such as burger, pizza, or sushi, by using image classification.This model may be especially helpful for tourists to understand food even if they donâ€™t know that food.This AI was created because I struggled with understanding the names of foods when traveling abroad, this AI helps me do that.

## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

This re-trained resNet-18 model was created on Jetson Nano and trained on a dataset of many kinds of food images.
